# My Personal Project

**Car market application**. The application will allow a user to view a collection of cars for sale,
and list their own car as well. Each car for sale will have details that the user must enter when
listing, such as make, model, year, colour, mileage, etc. Their will be a page to view the listings,
and the user should be able to click a listing to view more details. In theory, someone wishing to
buy or sell a car would use this application. This project is of interest to me since I feel I have
decent knowledge about cars and enjoy learning about them.

Some extra features that I would like to include but may decide not to depending on time/difficulty
would be the ability to edit listings, add pictures (or select from stock photos maybe),
randomly generating listings to simulate the experience better, allow the user to have an inventory
of purchased, currently listed, or sold cars. Or perhaps a history of those interactions. These
features may overstep the requirements of the project so it is purely based on time and complexity.
